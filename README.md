  Shutil module in Python provides many functions of high-level operations on files and collections of files. It comes under Pythonâ€™s standard utility modules. This module helps in automating process of copying and removal of files and directories.
shutil.copyfile() method in Python is used to copy the content of source file to destination file. Metadata of the file is not copied. Source and destination must represent a file and destination must be writable. If destination already exists then it will be replaced with the source file otherwise a new file will be created.
If source and destination represents the same file then SameFileError exception will be raised.
Syntax: shutil.copyfile(source, destination, *, follow_symlinks = True)
